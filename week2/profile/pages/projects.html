          <p>I completed a project which explored Self-Organised Criticality – the idea that ‘high amplitude events’ (e.g. earthquakes) are actually a part of a distribution of events.</p>
          <p>The task was to write a C++ code which would evolve a forest fire. In order to examine the system, I wrote, and applied, an algorithm which labelled clusters on a grid. This enabled me to study various characteristics of the remaining live-tree clusters, such as area and circumference, along with their corresponding frequency. With this data, I formulated a scientific report which successfully concluded that the system was indeed Self-Organised Critical.</p>

          <p>In my final year project at university, I studied a niche field of theoretical ultra-cold atoms. More specifically, I studied the Emptiness Formation Probability of one-dimensional Bosons at temperatures close to absolute zero. Particles in transit between two points in space will favour a ‘classical path’ which acts to minimise the action associated with the Hamiltonian of the system. For the quantum and non-classical system as described above, it is important to consider every possible path in which the particle may move along. Consequently, I utilised Quantum Field Theory and high-level mathematical techniques such as Feynman Path Integrals in order to describe the statistical nature of where one would expect the Bosons to reside within the system.</p>
